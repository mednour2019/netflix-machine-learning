# Machine Learning Analysis of Netflix Data
# The project is in master Branch
# Description
The project aims to analyze Netflix data to gain insights into different types of content, specifically focusing on distinguishing between films and TV shows. By applying machine learning techniques, the analysis will classify and provide knowledge about the nature of each entry, whether it is a film or a TV show. This will help in understanding patterns and trends within Netflix's content library.
